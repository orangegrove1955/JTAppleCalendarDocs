# JTAppleCalendar Docs

Temporary placeholder for JTAppleCalendarDocs while patchthecode.com is down

As per [this issue](https://github.com/patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar/issues/1397) in the JTAppleCalendar repo, the documentation for the project is currently down due to webhosting costs. This repo provides a temporary, alternative way of checking the documentation while [patchthecode](https://github.com/patchthecode) finds a more permanent solution

From the files uploaded in [this comment](https://github.com/patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar/issues/1397#issuecomment-2054113374) in the thread, I have endeavoured to bring as much functionality as possible, so that users may be able to do basic troubleshooting and installation.

While I have endeavoured to correct as many links as possible, there may still be broken ones on some pages I have missed. If so, please raise an issue, or better yet, submit a PR for this repo to fix the links.
